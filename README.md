# Array Cardio Day 2

## Description

This is the seventh exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The challenge was to practice working with arrays and methods.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- While I have used the find method previously, some and every methods were new to me.
- The most interesting part of this exercise was the two variations for deleting the comment. In the first method, splice was used to mutate the original array. In the second, we used slice to take the elements before and after the specified index and make a new array, allowing the original to remain unchanged.
